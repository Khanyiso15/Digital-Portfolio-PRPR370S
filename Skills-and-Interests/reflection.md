# Skills and Interests Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
In the Skills and Interests section of the module, I explored my core values, skills, and vocational interests.

**Task:**  
To identify which types of jobs align with my personality and preferences.

**Action:**  
I took the quiz and reflected on moments of pride and fulfillment in my life. I discovered my interest areas fall under Investigative, Enterprising, and Social categories.

**Result:**  
I now aim for careers like business analyst or tech consultant where I can problem-solve, lead, and interact with peopleâ€”aligning with both my values and strengths.
