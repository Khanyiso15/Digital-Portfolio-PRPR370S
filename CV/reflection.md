# Create a CV Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of the work readiness module, I had to develop a polished and professional CV.

**Task:**  
Create a one-page CV that reflects my skills, education, and potential as an ICT graduate.

**Action:**  
I used a minimalist professional layout, clearly structured my information into sections like Education, Skills, and Contact Details, and ensured my CV was free from typos and formatting issues.

**Result:**  
I produced a clean, professional CV that Iâ€™ve already used to apply for internship roles. It clearly communicates my readiness for the job market.
