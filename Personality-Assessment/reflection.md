# Personality Assessment Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
As part of the work readiness program, I took a personality quiz to understand which careers fit me best.

**Task:**  
To align my career aspirations with my natural strengths and personality preferences.

**Action:**  
Based on the RIASEC model, I identified myself as Investigative and Enterprising. I enjoy leadership, research, and influencing others.

**Result:**  
This confirmed my interest in roles like ICT consultant and project lead. I plan to pursue further training and mentorship to enhance these traits.
