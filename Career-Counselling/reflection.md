# Career Counselling Reflection (STAR)

**Situation:**  
During the work readiness training, I completed lessons and quizzes related to career development.

**Task:**  
I needed to create a realistic career development plan that matches my skills and interests.

**Action:**  
Using the SMART framework taught in the module, I set a clear goal: "To become a certified ICT Project Manager within three years." I identified gaps in skills like project coordination and leadership.

**Result:**  
I now have a focused plan with SMART goals and action steps that guide my career development journey, including pursuing mentorship and project management certifications.
